 Fitness-Tracking-Application:
 In this code I have created a fitness tracking application using SFML and C++.
 It has three types of users admin, trainer and gym members.
 An admin can add new users, notifications, location based activity, add challenges and delete them as well. An admin can also see people who have completed their challenges uptil now.
 Similarly a trainer can view his profile, start a workout, see his feed and followers.
 A user however has more options he/she can view his profile, see his notification, view his feed, add a post, check his location based activity, view and participate in challenges, follow or hire a trainer, start a workout, add their meals and check their workout and nutrition tracking as well.
